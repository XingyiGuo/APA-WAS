# Introduction

In this study, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated in multiple normal tissues, along with the matched whole genome sequencing (WGS) data generated in blood samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and large-scale GWAS data for cancers of breast, ovary, prostate, colorectum, lung, and pancreas to conduct APA-WAS to search for susceptibility genes and loci of these common cancers.
